          Base, the child of Coinbase was launched in 2023 with only one aim of
          getting people onchain with utmost convenience. Okay, enough
          description. Let me actually make you understand these terms:

        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
          Just like open source is accessible to everyone, Base is open to the
          whole decentralized ecosystem and not just to Coinbase. Innovation is
          the aim here.

          Now let&apos;s jump more into the technical problem of L1s. Layer 1
          blockchain like Ethereum are extensively utilized and hence, get
          exhausted. This exhaustion causes congestion which eventually leads to
          slow down the whole process, making it expensive. This affects
          Scalability.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mt-2">
          While Scalability has always been an issue in the blockchain
          ecosystem, solutions like Base, an L2, have to jump in.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
          Layer 1 is like a traffic jammed only highway to commute. As
          there&apos;s only one road to travel, there will be congestion
          creating frustration among everyone while sacrificing their time &
          fuel.
          <br />
          Now, think of L2 as an alternative road, like an express highway. Same
          work, more efficient.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mt-4">So, Base solves the blockchain trilemma:</p>
        <ol className="text-lg mt-4 list-decimal ml-4">
          <li className="text-lg mt-2">
            <strong>Security:</strong> As Base works on top of Ethereum, we get
            the best of worlds ie. Ethereum&apos;s security.
          </li>
          <li className="text-lg mt-2">
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> By diverting the flow from Mainnet
            [Ethereum] to the ‚Äúside‚Äù chain [Base] to process the information, we
            are scaling the flow, that too way too quicker.
          </li>
          <li className="text-lg mt-2">
            <strong>Decentralization:</strong> The most basic yet intricate
            detail which enhances the transparency & fairness providing equal
            information to everyone.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="text-lg mt-2">
          All of the above possibilities are achieved because of ‚ÄúOptimistic
          Roll-Ups‚Äù. Yeah, the fun named tech. (a lesson, don&apos;t judge a
          book by it&apos;s cover)
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mt-2">
          The &quot;optimistic&quot; nature refers to the fact that transactions
          are presumed valid until proven otherwise, avoiding the need to
          generate expensive cryptographic proofs for every transaction. And
          once confirmed, they rolled like sushi, back to Ethereum.
